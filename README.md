# Linux-Outbound-Traffic-Filter
Simple C++ script that uses winsocket library to filter outbound traffic. 

This script is designed to analyze and block any outbound TCP / UDP traffic one by one and trace to end-point server where the traffic is going.
Best use for this script is to analyze for any possible malware, botnets, root hacks.

I'm still working on this to display ports, location of the IP, etc.
